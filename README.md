# DEBSEC
A humble and lightweight "guide" for Linux users looking for a more security-hardened desktop experience, but don't quite have the free time to read the vast amount of documentation required to achieve such a setup. Spoiler-alert: Reading ahead!

# Introduction
I greatly admire the work of OpenBSD, but I still require a more maintsream OS like Linux for popular software like Steam and other things. So I sought to find the next best alternative for my particular needs. After daily driving security-centric software projects like Kicksecure for a month, I created this guide. This "guide" (if you can call it a guide) is more of a grocery list of software projects and applications that I think are great and could meet the widest needs of most desktop Linux users.

My hope is that by completing this guide, the user will have a secure Debian-based system that is moderately hardened beyond the defaults of a vanilla Debian/SpiralLinux installation.

To clarify, I am not an Engineer/Inventor: I am a traffic cop. Yours Truly is simply here to direct you to the fine work others before him have already done.

My goal with this guide is to consolidate all the choice morsels of the most common security advice and suggestions any Linux beginner can find on social media (various YouTubers, Reddit, PrivacyGuides.org, distro forums, etc.) and put it all into one burrito.  

# Target Audience
Intermediate Linux users looking for a security-focused desktop Linux experience. Linux Users who wish to be secure but don't always need the extreme privacy/anonymity of Whonix or TAILS. QubesOS is most certainly a secure operating system, but not everyone meets the recommended hardware requirements for a comfortable experience and the user must radically change their habits if they wish to use QubesOS effectively.

If you're looking to secure a server, then I don't know if this guide is for you. If you're looking to be standards compliant (with, like, HIPPA or whatever), then I don't know if this guide is for you. If you're trying to avoid state actors, then this guide is definitely not for you.

I doubt Advanced Linux users will be interested in this guide (for themselves) as I assume they already have their own dotfiles, configs, and shell scripts already prepared for this kind of stuff. But your feedback is certainly welcome!

# Disclaimers
WARNING:  The Kicksecure Team officially supports only vanilla Debian. They consider using their project on systems other than vanilla Debian are "untested systems."  I personally haven't bumped into any catestrophic (or minor) issues using SpiralLinux + Kicksecure on a daily basis, but your mileage may vary.

# Conclusion
Security is a journey; it's not a destination. Hopefully, by the end of this guide, you should have a moderately secure system hardened beyond the defaults of a typical Debian/SpiralLinux installation. A good starting point to choose to add or subtract software packages from your new system.

# Special Thanks
Many thanks to these fine folks and their projects for creating amazing software for the Linux Community. Yours Truly included!
